End mounted funnel Prusa i2
================

The fan and funnel are mounted on the end of the standard Prusa i2 X-Carriage.
The funnel has two ducts.
[1] for the air flow across the "cold end"
[2] for air flow directed to the tip of the "hot end"

This model in its current form is very very slow to render in OpenSCAD.  So you if you plan to render this yourself make sure to use a high speed computer and be VERY patient. It will get there but expect to wait a good 2 hours or more.

ToDo: Attempt to make a more efficient OpenSCAD model.
